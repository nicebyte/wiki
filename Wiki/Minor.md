# Definition

Given an $n \times n$ matrix $\boldsymbol{M}$, a $k$ _-th minor_ of $\boldsymbol{M}$ is the determinant of a $(n-k) \times (n-k)$ matrix obtained by deleting $k$ rows
and $k$ columns from $\boldsymbol{M}$. For example, a _first minor_ is the determinant of a matrix obtained by deleting one row and one column from the original
matrix.
